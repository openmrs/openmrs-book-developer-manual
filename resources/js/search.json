Traditionally, patient data were recorded in paper records. However, advances in the field of medicine are introducing the need to manage very large amounts of data. Because paper medical records are inherently passive, they can not evaluate or trigger meaningful actions in response to their content. These challenges led to the development of many different Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems. These software tools promote meaningful use of patient health records.","Over the past several decades, several commercial and open source EMR tools have been developed and implemented with varied levels of success. OpenMRS is one of them!","Patient registration clerks using OpenMRS"]},{"l":"Improving Health Care Quality","p":["EMRs like OpenMRS can help improve the quality of healthcare in multiple ways."]},{"l":"1. Accuracy","p":["The adoption of health IT can significantly reduce the potential for medical errors. For example, an EMR can resolve incidents where hand-written physician records are misinterpreted, and incorrect medication provided to a patient."]},{"l":"2. Efficiency","p":["EMR systems can improve the efficiency of data exchange between multiple health IT applications. They can also prevent duplication of services, thereby reducing chances of unnecessarily extending a patient's hospital stay and maximizing use of hospital resources."]},{"l":"3. Better Patient Care","p":["Data collected by an EMR application can be used to support decision-making by health care professionals. Computerized guidelines can also offer benefits to help clinicians and patients make better decisions, thereby increasing the likelihood that health care decisions have a positive outcome on the patient."]},{"l":"4. Understanding Data About Public Health","p":["The data captured via an EMR system can be used to explore data used to create and monitor public health standards. For example, vaccination records stored in an EMR can provide a deep insight into the population of a state or country, and the health of those vaccinated people over time."]},{"l":"5. Serving As a Record of Patient Care","p":["Patient data recorded in an EMR system can serve as a historical record of patient care, and is usable both as a legal record as well as a means of evaluating the quality of health care provided. For example, patient records in an EMR system that record health care activities at a certain location can be transferred to another location when that patient moves somewhere else. The information provided to the new physician can be re-used to assess a patient's health condition."]},{"i":"challenges-of-maintaining-emrs","l":"Challenges of Maintaining EMR's"},{"l":"1. The Need For Standardized Clinical Terminology","p":["Both variation in terms used by health care professionals and a general lack of standardization, have both had a significant impact on the meaningful use of health IT applications. For example, a clinician in one wing of the hospital might use the term \"heart attack\", while another in a different department might use the term \"myocardial infarction\" to refer to the same thing. This lack of standardization reduces the quality and usefulness of the data. The most common way to handle this problem is use of standardized medical terminology."]},{"i":"2-data-privacy-confidentiality-and-security-issues","l":"2. Data Privacy, Confidentiality And Security Issues","p":["Given the significance of medical data, it is extremely important that confidentiality of patient records are ensured at all times, and that access to these records is strictly controlled and is only given to relevant users. For example, different types of EMR users may only require access to certain types of data or metadata, based on their roles in the health care facility."]},{"l":"3. Challenges Related to Data Entry","p":["It's necessary to ensure that entering data into an EMR is efficient and easy, so that providers are able to manage their time in a productive manner. If a health care professional is overworked or distracted, mistakes may occur that have adverse effects on a patient's health."]},{"l":"4. Integration of Multiple Health IT Applications","p":["Consistent with other efforts to ensure meaningful use of Health IT systems, data stored in the EMR system should be easily exchangeable to and from other medical applications. For example, the integration of separate health applications into a regional or national Health Information Exchange (HIE) requires that an EMR is capable of easily exchanging data with these external systems."]}],[{"l":"Solving the health it challenges our response","p":["AMPATH Clinic, Eldoret, Kenya, ca. 2004","OpenMRS was conceived in 2004 specifically to solve the problem of managing health care information in the developing world. Today, connectivity and accessibility are critical pieces for health information systems. In most countries, this information is still in silos and is not accessible to those who need it—patients, clinicians, researchers, epidemiologists, and planners. Based on best practices and institutional knowledge from founding partners Regenstrief Institute & Partners In Health. The goal of OpenMRS was to become a platform that could be flexible enough for use in a variety of contexts in settings that had very different requirements.","Both organizations knew they were doing similar work and wanted to work together to build a common platform to save time and effort. Late in 2004, Ben Wolfe from Regenstrief Institute became the first full-time programmer working on OpenMRS, and Darius Jazayeri from Partners In Health soon followed. For ease of work and other practical reasons, they set up a project wiki and used an online instance of Subversion for source control. Over time, word spread about the project and because the materials were publicly available, other people started contributing. The group didn't set out to create an open source software project, but it quickly became evident that is what had evolved.","OpenMRS first \"went live\" in February 2006 at the AMPATH project in Western Kenya. Partners In Health turned on OpenMRS in Rwinkwavu, Rwanda, in August of the same year. The South African Medical Research Council first launched on the system at Richmond Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal at the end of 2006. Since then, the rate of installation and use of OpenMRS has continued to increase at a rapid pace. The software has been downloaded in nearly every country on the planet and is used in implementations from single traveling clinics to nation-wide installations in hospitals and clinics throughout countries like Rwanda."]},{"l":"What We Created","p":["OpenMRS was designed as a patient-centric medical record application that records the details of interactions between health care providers and patients. Information is stored in a way that makes it easy to summarize and analyze, minimizing the use of unstructured information and maximizing the use of structured information. The software gathers a patient’s treatment details into a single patient chart. Having this complete patient history available in one place empowers clinicians to make better decisions about care, while also enabling a deeper analysis of patient health in order to draw more meaningful conclusions on improving outcomes.","Technically speaking, OpenMRS is a Java-based web application capable of running on laptops in small clinics or large servers for nation-wide use. Our platform improves health outcomes by providing a timely, comprehensive, and coordinated foundation for delivery of health care. Add-on modules created by other users allow functionality to be easily added or removed from the system. This modular architecture allows users to customize OpenMRS to local health care needs, and reduces the need for custom programming.","OpenMRS has served as a training platforms for developers since its beginning. The project has participated in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) since 2007, offering university students a chance to practice software development as well as free and open source project management skills. Many training programs have flourished throughout the developing world, increasing the number of people with technological and entrepreneurial skills to support Health IT implementations. The community has assisted in facilitating training programs in places like Rwanda that teach students to develop medical information systems like OpenMRS."]},{"l":"Building A Community","p":["Volunteers from around the world have created the OpenMRS Community, a group of talented individuals from many different backgrounds including technology, health care, and international development. Together, we're building the world's most comprehensive and flexible health technology platform to support the delivery of health care in some of the world's most challenging environments.","Our community came together to specifically respond to the needs of people actively building and managing health systems in the developing world—places where AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria afflict the lives of millions. We may have started out to help a single clinic in Kenya, but in the last few years OpenMRS has grown dramatically to be used in thousands of research and clinical settings across the planet. We're very proud of the innovators using OpenMRS to improve health care worldwide. We have a large, active community of volunteer developers and implementers and would be glad to have you join us!","Since its beginning, the number of individual and organizational volunteers who participate in the OpenMRS community has seen steady growth, tripling in size in the first part of this decade alone. These individuals participate in various ways, from documentation and bug reports, from training and providing support to other community members. Recent releases of the OpenMRS core application consistently had between 50 and 100 contributors. An even larger vibrant ecosystem of add-on module developers provides infinite customization to the system. Additionally, our collaborations with other free and open source software projects such as Open Data Kit and Pentaho have produced volunteer contributions to OpenMRS, and employees of many commercial consulting organizations have contributed countless hours to developing and improving OpenMRS.","We have also launched an independent not-for-profit organization to help support the project's needs as it grows. The purpose of this organization is to provide technical infrastructure and community management, to assist collaboration and cooperation of project volunteers throughout the world, and to provide training and support to those who seek to implement OpenMRS as a key part of a medical informatics strategy in clinics, hospitals, and government health organizations.","The mission of the OpenMRS community is to improve health care delivery in resource-constrained environments by working together as a global community to create a robust, scalable, user-driven, open source medical record system platform."]},{"i":"we-envision-a-world-where","l":"We Envision A World Where...","p":["Models exist to implement health IT in a way that decreases costs, increases capacity, and lessens the disparities between wealthy and resource-poor environments.","Open standards enable people to use health IT systems to share information and reduce effort. Concepts and processes can be easily shared to enable health care professionals and patients to work together more effectively.","Medical software helps ease the work of health care providers and administrators to provide them with the tools to improve health outcomes all over the world Looking forward","From its humble beginnings as a solution to a problem in a small African town, OpenMRS has become the largest health IT project on the planet. Between 2006 and 2012, the installation of OpenMRS at AMPATH in Kenya has recorded over 5 million heath care encounters points of data for nearly 200,000 patients, helping to save untold thousands of lives. Every day, similar stories are retold somewhere else around the world with the assistance of thousands of volunteers.","The OpenMRS community continues to grow, and we are excited that you're ready to join us. Regardless of your background or interests, there is a way for you to both contribute and gain from the work of others in the OpenMRS community. In the next section we'll explore OpenMRS around the world today and the many exciting prospects for the future."]}],[{"l":"OpenMRS Today","p":["OpenMRS Atlas, October 2016"]},{"l":"A Snapshot","p":["Today, the OpenMRS community is a widespread network of dedicated individuals and groups focused on improving the state of medical care in developing countries. As Health IT projects go, we're really big!","4,000,000 lines of code","70,000 downloads since 2010","169 countries","6 continents","As a developer, you are about to become a member of this worldwide community dedicated to improving global health and saving lives. You'll make health platforms that create global synergy and join a vibrant and welcoming community. In this chapter, we'll explore who we are and where we're going."]},{"l":"Where And Who We Are","p":["As you can see in the map above, you can find OpenMRS is use all around the world. For an interactive map built with data from some of our implementation sites, visit: https://atlas.openmrs.org","Users, implementers, developers and contributors come from a wide variety of backgrounds and interests. We collaborate, cooperate and communicate in different ways, but we all gain from and share in the work of others within our community.","With over 50 active projects, the OpenMRS developer community is a vibrant and thriving group of dedicated people working from around the world. The code we produce is used in hundreds of countries in different ways. From research labs in the United States to mobile clinics in Nigeria, OpenMRS acts as a platform for improving the health of citizens in numerous countries."]},{"l":"Varieties of Usage","p":["Not only is OpenMRS used in many different places, it's also being used to meet many different needs. In Kenya, it is used to support health care delivery for hundreds of thousands of patients at a network of over 50 clinics--some connected by typical networks, but many where the connection requires offline synchronization to external storage that can be physically transported between sites! Another NGO uses a central OpenMRS server connected to clinics in multiple countries via satellite Internet connections. In Malawi, creative individuals with a talent for technology have created a mobile cart running OpenMRS that physicians roll around their clinic, interacting with the system using a touchscreen. In Rwanda, the national ministry of health has worked to roll out a connected national health care system using OpenMRS. In the United States, OpenMRS is used to track patients at large sporting events, for mobile providers of health care to homeless people, and as a personal health record that allows cancer patients to share treatment and home health care information with caregivers and family members."]},{"l":"The Future of OpenMRS"},{"l":"Usability","p":["At this stage, OpenMRS requires a fairly sophisticated team of implementers to install and run. The most recent releases of OpenMRS and current development is focused on creating \"ready to go\" implementations that would allow more clinic sites to take advantage of a sophisticated, scalable EMR without needing the expertise to support and maintain it at a low level."]},{"l":"Data Collection","p":["OpenMRS is backed by a data model driven by a concept dictionary, allowing for the collection of coded, reusable data without requiring changes to the data model. Because the platform is not based on a disease-centric data model, it can be adapted for use in tuberculosis, malaria, or more general medical care.","Furthermore, we also promote the implementation of health data standards which enable the convenient exchange of medical data. OpenMRS supports the generation and consumption of HL7 messaging, the most commonly used health data standard for exchanging information. This allows external systems to communicate and exchange medical data in a more coherent manner."]},{"l":"Integrating With Other Systems","p":["In line with recent efforts to improve the meaningful use of healthcare, OpenMRS has actively pursued methods to enforce connectivity between piecemeal health IT implementations. On these grounds, we have encouraged the creation of modules which enable OpenMRS to interact with other related systems.","Examples of our efforts include interoperability between OpenMRS and OpenELIS (a Laboratory Information System) as well as between OpenMRS to DHIS2 (District Health Information System 2) using the SDMX-HD standard.","Additionally, OpenMRS is also involved in efforts to promote the development of regional and national level Health Information Exchanges(HIE). This initiative sees the collaboration between multiple health applications to enable connectivity between piecemeal implementations. In this capacity, OpenMRS been adopted as the Shared Health Record(SHR) of the openHIE collaboration initiative emerging to assist in the strengthening of national health information exchanges for the underserved."]},{"l":"Where You Fit In","p":["We're constantly working with new technologies for stability and performance. We strive to create the best software for health IT around the world, and we want you to help us get there!

The leadership of such projects is very \"flat\" -- meaning that there isn't a lot of bureaucracy to deal with. On the other hand, you'll find that as a developer, you're given great freedom in finding interesting work and designing what gets built. The more code and ideas you contribute, the more you'll become a leader in the project.","\"People should feel that their connection to a project, and influence over it, is directly proportional to their contributions.\" - ** Karl Fogel, Producing Open Source Software **","Free and open source software projects offer an ideal setting for coordination and crowd-sourcing of ideas and solutions. You should always try to be open to what others might have to say about your ideas and code -- great ideas don't necessarily have a single owner or contributor! Listen to what others have to say, and pay attention to what they're doing ... there's a lot to learn from everyone in the OpenMRS community. Working together can be hugely beneficial to everyone involved, and the sharing of ideas can yield rich results.","One of the easiest ways to build functionality in the OpenMRS ecosystem is to use our modular architecture, which is covered in more detail later in this book. Add-on modules allow you to try lots of different ideas to solve problems. Modules also let you to build upon the work of others through dependencies."]},{"l":"Play Nicely","p":["The OpenMRS community has established a Code of Conduct. It's less of a list of rules as much as it is some useful guidance about ways to work in the community to help each other and be successful. You should take a moment to read it and be familiar with the values mentioned there, which include:","Be considerate","Be respectful","Be collaborative","When you disagree, consult others","When you are unsure, ask for help","Step down considerately"]},{"l":"Working Asynchronously","p":["You'll find lots of people willing to help and give advice in the OpenMRS community, but they might be located across the planet from you. That means you should try to plan your work tasks to work asynchronously. For a quick answer, searching Google, our Wiki pages finding someone to chat with on our IRC channel or Telegram Group works well. If you haven't gotten answer to your question or discover that your question doesn't appear to have been asked before, consider posting your question to Ask OpenMRS. Since you may end up waiting for an answer before you can continue, having a few tasks, issues, or projects going in parallel will help you to feel more productive while you wait for answers or supplemental information to get your work accomplished."]},{"l":"Collaboration vs. Cooperation","p":["People often speak of working collaboratively on a project when large groups are involved. Before using these terms, it's important to understand the differences between the words collaboration and cooperation. When people collaborate, they work closely together and depend on each other to accomplish a single goal. When people cooperate, however, they coordinate their work on \"selfish\" but similar goals. Collaboration works well in small groups, but cooperation allows large software projects to support both individual and group goals.","Both types of work happen in the OpenMRS community. When looking at the development of code for the OpenMRS core software, you'll find lots of collaboration. Developers working on core parts of the software need to frequently communicate their ideas in detail to avoid causing problems for other developers. The same holds true when there are several developers working on an OpenMRS add-on module.","Cooperation happens when looking at the different teams who develop OpenMRS modules. Those teams are most successful when they cooperate to prevent duplicate efforts, such as creating two modules that provide the same functionality.","As an OpenMRS developer, you should plan to cooperate more than you collaborate. This means you'll need to have a good understanding of your personal or small group goals, and you'll need to communicate more than you might be accustomed. This chapter will review some tips on how best to do so."]},{"l":"Find Mentors","p":["Mentors are a great way for new developers to learn about participating in the OpenMRS community. We're a very friendly group of people, and there are plenty of people who, not too long ago, were new to our project just like you. They can help you find interesting work, answer questions about getting your environment set up, or help connect you to other people in the community who share your interests.","The easiest way to find a mentor is to join the community conversations at OpenMRS Talk. If you haven't already, make a post in the Welcome - please introduce yourself! topic, providing a short description of what interests you and some of your goals with OpenMRS. If you get stuck or have issues at any time, send an e-mail to our community management team at community@openmrs.org and they will help answer any questions you have.","The OpenMRS community also regularly participates in formal mentoring programs. Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a summer (in the northern hemisphere) program for university students age 18 and over, offering a stipend to do development work on open source projects such as OpenMRS. Applications generally open each spring. The FOSS Outreach Program for Women (OPW) is a program for all women age 18 and over that offers 3-month projects on development, documentation, project management, and other tasks in open source projects. Check out the web sites for both programs to learn more about them."]},{"l":"Forming Questions","p":["One of the greatest things about a free and open source software project is the large community of developers, contributors, and users available to help you find answers to questions or inspire you.","Our project has been around many years, so there is a lot of reference material available to understand why certain design decisions were made. Some of this material is current and much of it can be useful for a historical perspective. When developing questions to ask others in the community, it's important to do some background research first to make sure that there isn't already a readily-available answer."]},{"i":"communicate-publicly--productively","l":"Communicate Publicly & Productively","p":["In an open source project, all decisions happen in public. This means you should avoid private conversations such as instant messages, phone calls, and face-to-face meetings -- particularly when brainstorming or making decisions about community software design. We have many different public tools available for our community to support these conversations and those tools are described in detail elsewhere in this book. Ensuring that decisions are made in public venues maximizes participation and exposes those decisions to as many brilliant minds as possible. Try not to make decisions in private, or you might miss out on interesting ideas.","Because we're a large project, much written communication gets generated every day for other developers to read. To help, try to do your part in maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio on mailing lists or other communication tools. Think before you post a message, and make sure what you're writing adds value to the conversation. Responses like \"me too!\" or \"+1\" are rarely productive."]},{"l":"Avoid Bikeshedding","p":["Although we encourage public discussions about our software design, it's also important to avoid non-productive conversations about trivial details. This type of anti-pattern best described by the concept of bikeshedding, which gets its name from a 1960s book about management. In the book, C. Northcote Parkinson described how it might be often easier to get approval for an expensive nuclear power plant than it could be to discuss what color to paint a bike shed. Everyone feels they have a valid opinion of what color to paint the bike shed, but only certain qualified people can comment on the design of a reactor. Don't let yourself fall into this trap -- avoid these wasteful conversations on trivial topics.","See http://om.rs/newdevbikeshed for more information about bikeshedding."]},{"l":"Commit Early And Often","p":["One of the biggest (and often most difficult) lessons for open source developers to learn is commit changes to your source code repository early and often. Don't wait until you are finished with a project,or even a single feature. In the past, OpenMRS used the Subversion version control system which made this more painful. However, with DVCS systems like GitHub in use now for most of our software, it's much easier to get your work-in-progress published online as you go. There are a few reasons to embrace this behavior.","First, by committing early you'll have more chance for others to stumble across your work. They may have very valuable feedback or ideas that you might want to consider to make your project more useful. They may also have already written something very similar and may prevent you from duplicating effort.","By committing your work often, you'll be protected in case of an accidental data loss. You'll also be able to share your progress with others, so they can get a better idea how much work remains. If you're committing code regularly and a lot of work remains, you might find someone to help you by squashing bugs or adding additional features.","Don't be afraid that your work appears \"not ready\". After all, it probably isn't ready yet! In free & open source projects, one of the most important practices is to share your work in progress. Make sure you do your part."]},{"i":"share--license-your-work","l":"Share & License Your Work","p":["We recommend naming your source code repository to include the word \"OpenMRS\" so others can more easily find your work. The OpenMRS community has a convention of naming repositories in the form \"openmrs-category-name\". For modules, this takes the form \"openmrs-module-moduleid\". For example, if you're creating the FooBar module, you might name your repository \"openmrs-module-foobar\". Similarly, when you're at a point that you want to introduce your project or projects to others in the community, we strongly encourage you to do so! The easiest way to do this is to write a short description of your project along with links to more information,","It's also important to consider what type of license your work will have. If you don't provide a license with your software, it might remain copyrighted and its use might still be restricted in ways which you may not intend. (The specifics of what would happen depend on the laws where you are.)","Many different free and open source software licenses exist, and sometimes it can be hard to choose one. The creators of GitHub have created http://om.rs/newdevchoose which is an easy way to compare some of the popular FOSS licenses currently in use.","The OpenMRS core application is licensed under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version 2, along with a healthcare disclaimer (essentially a disclaimer for how the software is used in health care settings).

Mailing Lists","p":["You may find archived mailing list entries when searching for OpenMRS-related information on the internet. The community used mailing lists for several years before switching from mailing lists to OpenMRS Talk. Our forum supports both online and email communication."]},{"l":"7. JIRA Issue Tracker","p":["JIRA is the software that tracks issues for the OpenMRS community. It records issues and bugs that people have noticed and need to be addressed, feature requests, as well as projects being worked on. Developers, users and implementers all use JIRA to report, comment and solve problems and create content.","You should use JIRA to create a new issue if you find a bug. Be sure to include a clear description of how to recreate the error, the error message if applicable, the version of OpenMRS you are using, the type and version of the database you are using, any additional modules or customizations, and any other relevant information. If applicable, copy and paste the full Java stack trace. The easiest way to report an OpenMRS bug is by using the web form at http://issues.openmrs.org. If you'd like to be more specific, you'll need to use the appropriate JIRA project to report a bug for the OpenMRS core/trunk application, a specific add-on module, etc.","Bugs in JIRA have four specific phases of their life cycle. First, someone notices a bug and creates a JIRA issue to report it. Second, the bug is validated by other members of the community to makes sure enough details have been included. Third, a person begins to code a patch for the bug. Finally, upon the completion of the code, it goes through a code review to make sure it is a valid fix.","You should also use JIRA to create a new issue if you start a new project. As a developer, JIRA is a great place to find a first contribution. The issue navigator also keeps track of introductory tickets that can be a good place for a new developer to get started."]},{"l":"8. Git","p":["Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) which allows many developers to work on one project without having a specific network connection. Most developers host their source code on GitHub, though feel free to host yours wherever makes sense for your needs. We recommend creating an account on GitHub so that you can clone (copy) repositories (folders of source code) to your local machine. You can then make changes on your local machine and push (send) them to GitHub. Git can be very easy to use once you learn a few key commands, and is a great collaborative tool for developers. It allows you to write messages each time you commit (save) what you've done, and keeps a log of these messages.","Writing good commit messages is an important part of letting other developers know what you've been working on. Make sure that your commit messages are specific and concise. Each commit should address one ticket change. Don't combine multiple issues into one commit. Make sure the commit contains the ticket number. When in doubt, look at what other people have written in their commit messages! Reading through commit messages from other developers is also important to know what has been done and what is being done.","For more in-depth training on how to use Git for OpenMRS, see: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/","To learn more about OpenMRS coding conventions, see: https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Coding+Conventions","For more information about our repositories: https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Core+Modules","All OpenMRS modules are available on GitHub at:* https://github.com/openmrs"]},{"i":"lets-get-started","l":"Let's Get Started","p":["As you've read in this section, there are many tools to help you work with other community members, so dive right in and introduce yourself on IRC and create your personal wiki space.

Understanding how the basic system fits together is the most important thing you need for now."]},{"l":"Technical Overview","p":["OpenMRS is a framework built upon Java and other related frameworks. It is based on a modular architecture which consists of a core application and optional modules which provide additional functionality to the core workflows.","The key architectural components of the OpenMRS core can be depicted as follows:","An Overview of OpenMRS","The backbone of OpenMRS lies in its core API. The OpenMRS API has methods for all of the basic functions such as adding/updating a patient, encounter, observation, etc. Methods which enable this functionality are provided in service layer classes."]},{"l":"The Source Code Structure","p":["In OpenMRS framework and modules, there are different levels in the code architecture. The OpenMRS source code is divided into three main segments:","The User Interface (presentation)","The Service Layer","The Data Access layer","This layering isolates various system responsibilities from one another, to improve both system development and maintenance."]},{"l":"The Data Access layer","p":["The Data Access layer is an abstraction layer from the actual data model and its changes. It uses Hibernate as the Object Relational mapping tool, and Liquibase to manage relational database changes in a database-independent way.","The relationships between our domain objects and database tables are mapped using a mixture of Hibernate annotations and XML mapping files. The data access layer is exposed to the service layer through interfaces, thereby shielding it from implementation details such as which object relational mapping tool is being used. see openmrs DataModel at openmrs university"]},{"l":"The Service layer","p":["The Service layer is responsible for managing the business logic of the application. It is built around the Spring framework. The OpenMRS service layer classes make extensive use of the Spring framework for a number of tasks including the following:","Spring Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is used to provide separate cross cutting functions (for example: authentication, logging).","Spring Dependency Injection (DI) is used to provide dependencies between components.","Spring is used to manage transactions in between service layer classes"]},{"l":"User Interface layer","p":["The User Interface layer for the legacy application is built upon Spring MVC, Direct Web Remoting (DWR), JSP and JavaScript. DWR is used for AJAX functionality and it provides the mapping between our Java objects and methods to JavaScript objects and methods respectively. JQuery is used to simplify the interactions with Javascript and the browser. Spring MVC is used to provide the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Our domain objects serve as the Model. We have a mixture of controllers that subclass Spring's SimpleFormControllers and those which use Spring's @Controller annotation. For the new reference application user interface, we no longer use Spring MVC, DWR or JSP, but heavily use Groovy, JQuery, AngularJS, and more."]},{"l":"The Modular Architecture","p":["At the heart of OpenMRS is a custom module framework which lets you extend and modify the default functionality of the OpenMRS core in accordance to your needs. Modules are also structured like the OpenMRS core, and consist of user interface, data access and service layers.","Some OpenMRS functionality is pulled out into modules instead of being written into the core application. This allows users to upgrade the content in those modules without having to wait for the next OpenMRS release. Currently, the only core module used in OpenMRS is the Logic Module."]},{"l":"Associated Frameworks and Technology Stacks"},{"l":"Hibernate","p":["Hibernate is the object-relational mapping library used by OpenMRS. It allows users to describe the relationship between database tables and domain objects using xml configuration files or Java annotations.","Hibernate is also useful in managing dependencies between classes. As an example, the concept domain in the data model consists of tables named concept, concept_answer, concept_set and concept_name. It would be very difficult to keep up with where to store each part of the concept object and the relations between them if a user decides to update each table individually. However, using Hibernate, developers only need to concern themselves with the Concept object, and not the tables behind that object. The concept.hbm.xml mapping file does the work of knowing that the Concept object contains a collection of ConceptSet objects, a collection of ConceptName objects, etc.","However, also note that Hibernate enforces lazy loading - it will not load all associated objects until they are needed. For this reason, you must either fetch/save/manipulate your object in the same session (between one open/closeSession) or you must hydrate all object collections in the object by calling the getters(getConceptAnswers, getConceptNames, getSynonyms, etc)."]},{"l":"Spring MVC","p":["OpenMRS strongly subscribes to the Model-View-Controller pattern. Most controllers included in the OpenMRS core will be SimpleFormControllers and be placed in the org.openmrs.web.controller package. However, some controllers have been rewritten to use Spring 2.5+ annotations, and we recommend that you use these in the future. The model is set up in the controller's formBackingObject, and processed/saved in the processFormSubmission and onSubmit methods. The jsp views are placed in /web/WEB-INF/view.","Furthermore, not all files served by the webapp are run through Spring. The /web/WEB-INF/web.xml file maps certain web page extensions to the SpringController. All *.form, *.htm, and *.list pages are mapped. The SpringController then uses the mappings in the openmrs-servlet.xml file to know which pages are mapping to which Controller.","There are no jsp pages that are accessed directly. If a page's url is /admin/patients/index.htm, the jsp will actually reside in /web/WEB-INF/view/admin/patients/index.jsp. This is necessary so that we can do the redirect with the SpringController. Because the file being accessed ends with .htm, the SpringController is invoked by the web server. When the SpringController sees the url, it simply replaces .htm with .jsp and looks for the file in /web/WEB-INF/view/ according to the jspViewResolver bean in openmrs-servlet.xml. If the page being accessed was patient.form, the mapping in the urlMapping bean would have told spring to use the PatientFormController and the patientForm.jsp file."]},{"l":"Authentication and Authorization","p":["OpenMRS has a very granulated permissions system. Every action is associated with a Privilege, which in turn can be grouped into Roles. Examples of such privileges are \"Add Patient\", \"Update Patient\", \"Delete Patient\", \"Add Concept\", \"Update Concept\", and more. A Role can also point to a list of inherited roles. The role inherits all privileges from that inherited role. In this way, hierarchies of roles are possible. A User contains only a collection of Roles, not Privileges. These privileges are enforced in the service layer using AOP annotations. In a way, this also enssures Confidentiality of patients' Data by putting restrictions on the data Access."]},{"l":"Build Management","p":["OpenMRS uses Apache Maven for build management of the OpenMRS core and modules.","All information regarding the module being built, its dependencies on other external modules and components, the build order, directories, and required plug-ins are stored in the modules' pom.xml file.","Following release, these build artifacts are uploaded and maintained in a maven repository manager. A maven repository manager is used for this purpose due to a number of advantages that it provides. These advantages include:","Faster and more reliable builds","Improved collaboration","Component usage visibility","Enforcement of component standards","The Maven Repository used by OpenMRS is SonaType Nexus, which can be accessed at http://mavenrepo.openmrs.org/nexus/.","Artifacts maintained in the OpenMRS repository are:"]},{"l":"Releases","p":["Maven built releases (1.8.0 and later)","Ant built releases (1.5.0 up to 1.7.X)"]},{"l":"Snapshots","p":["Maven development versions"]},{"l":"Modules","p":["Module releases"]},{"l":"3rd Party Artifacts","p":["Libraries not found in other Maven repositories (HAPI)","Modified libraries (DWR, Hibernate, Liquibase, Simple XML)","Custom Maven plugins (OpenMRS omod plugin)"]},{"l":"Summary","p":["As you read the next section, keep in mind the important parts from this chapter:","OpenMRS consists of a core system, with a modular architecture to extend its functionality.","There are three main layers to the system: User Interface (Presentation), Service Layer and Data Access Layer.","OpenMRS makes extensive use of a number of frameworks including Spring and Hibernate.","We use Apache Maven for build management, JIRA for issue management and Github for version control.","Authentication/Authorisation is ensured by grouping different priviledges into roles which then are assigned to defined users and in turn it ensures the confidentiality of patients data and security of the system."]}],[{"l":"Data Model","p":["OpenMRS data model version 1.9.

They are very talented and very busy. You find and read a ticket they created when they realized functionality for adding, editing, saving, and listing of departments would be helpful to their implementation. For the purposes of this task, we will define a department as a hospital ward designed to perform a specific purpose.","Someone has left a comment **\"This would be a good module project!\"** on the ticket. You would love a new project to work on and happen to have an interest in the larger issue of \"departments\" as they relate to health informatics, so you are interested in taking up this task.","You send an email to Mrs. Zuma, the clinic's lead informatics person and ticket requester, expressing your interest and asking for some clarification about how a user would interact with the proposed Departments module. It is a good idea to touch base with the ticket requesters or would-be users before starting a project whose scope is likely more work and background than a straightforward bug-fix. While you wait for a reply (you might not know where in the world Mrs. Zuma lives), you decide to catch up on some emails of your own. You subscribed to the developers' mailing list a few days ago because you want to stay informed about what other people are working on and what issues they run into. You are excited about learning and watch a few OpenMRS University recordings too.","Mrs. Zuma is enthusiastic about you building this module for their clinic and potentially many others. She invites you to keep in touch as you go along.
