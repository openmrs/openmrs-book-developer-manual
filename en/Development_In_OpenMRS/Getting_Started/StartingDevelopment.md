## Choosing Between OWAs and Modules

Now, it is finally time to begin development on your new project. Before you can start, you must first consider what type of project you will need to create. OpenMRS currently has two ways for developers to add additional functionality to the server: *modules* and *Open Web Apps*. Generally speaking, modules are used for work that will primarily be based in the backend, while OWAs are used for work that is focused on frontend. If you are unsure which to pick, please seek advice from more experienced developers on the OpenMRS Talk.

Based on which one you choose, please consult one of the following links for more details:
