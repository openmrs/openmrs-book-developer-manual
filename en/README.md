********************************************

Thank you for your interest in the [OpenMRS Community!](http://openmrs.org/join-the-community/) We have created this book for people who are curious about becoming a developer using our software. This book serves as a quick guide for you to learn more about our history, what [OpenMRS does,](http://openmrs.org/about/mission/) and understand more about how our community works.

If you find yourself eager to get started, we've also included some practical advice on specific steps you can take right away to start doing development with the OpenMRS platform.

### Who Should Read This Book

Who are you exactly? We assume you are a software developer who is new to OpenMRS and someone who wants to learn more about the project and community that is OpenMRS. You're someone who shares our values and believes in our mission to improve health care delivery in resource-constrained environments by coordinating a global community to create and support this software. You're someone who wants to become a member of our community.

If you are not a developer and are more interested in implementation or a high level overview, then you may be more interested in the [OpenMRS Implementer Guide](http://guide.openmrs.org).
