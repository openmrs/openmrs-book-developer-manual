**Cohort:** A group of patients that can be defined by one or more common traits.

**Contributor:** Any community member who participates and contributes towards the OpenMRS community. 

**Core:** The source code for the OpenMRS API and core modules. The core does not include the source code for other, optional modules.

**Concept:** The fundamental unit of capturing clinical information within OpenMRS. Concepts represent a single idea and include both questions and answers. "cough", "address", "duration", and "yes" are a few examples.

**Concept dictionary:** A list of all the medical and program-related terms used in OpenMRS as questions and answers.

**Eclipse:** A multi-language, open source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) recommended for OpenMRS development 

**Customization:** The idea of adapting a system to suit one's specific, particular needs.

**Demo data:** A sample anonymized data set, including 5,000 patients and 500,000 observations, is available for most releases of OpenMRS.

**Electronic Medical Record:** A digital version of a paper chart/document used to record patient data.

**Electronic Medical Record system:** A computer system that allows for recording, storage, and retrieval of Electronic Medical Records.

**Encounter:** A clinical transaction in which a group of data (e.g., observations, notes, and orders) are recorded. Encounters generally involve one (or a few) providers. Examples include the paper "encounter form" with which OpenMRS started, an order entry session, a daily note &amp; associated orders written for patient while they are in the hospital, etc.

**Form:** An electronic form that may be used to enter or view data for a patient.

**Git:** A distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows multiple developers to works simultaneously on a project without the need for a common network connection. 

**GitHub:** A web based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. The OpenMRS source code is hosted on GitHub at http://github.com/openmrs

**Groovy:** A computer scripting language that allows automation and quick performance of tasks.

**Hibernate:** An object relational mapping (ORM) library for the Java language used by OpenMRS.

**HL7:** An abbreviation of Health Level Seven, a standard for exchanging information between medical applications.

**Implementer:** Someone who has or is in process of deploying OpenMRS in a specific location or context of use.

**Informatics:** The application and study of information technology and its use for society.

**IRC:** An abbreviation for Internet Relay Chat, an online tool to communicate with others in "real time". OpenMRS uses IRC to allow developers and implementers to collaborate and meet. http://openmrs.org/join-the-community/connect/

**JIRA:** An issue tracking /project management tool use by OpenMRS. Accessible at: https://tickets.openmrs.org/

**jRebel:** A Java development-time tool that decreases turnaround by instantly reloading changes to your code, without having to restart the container or redeploy the application. 

**Mailing list:** A collection a sub group of community members' e-mail addresses.

**Medical informatics:** A discipline of studying the use of informatics in field of medical science.

**Module:** A software package that extends or changes OpenMRS functionality without interfering with core OpenMRS code and have full access to OpenMRS.

**Module repository:** An online resource to find and maintain community-developed OpenMRS add-on modules. http://modules.openmrs.org/

**MySQL:** An open source relational database management system (RDMS) popular with web application and used by OpenMRS. 

**Observation:** An atomic unit of information that is recorded about a patient at a moment in time.

**Open source:** A method of developing software where the source code is freely available for others to examine, use, and build upon. Also a type of software development community based around sharing of work and collaboration.

**User:** A person who uses OpenMRS, or more specifically the data in the system representing that person.

**Visit:** A visit encompasses one or more encounters to describe an event where the patient has interacted with the healthcare system. Visits may occur within minutes/hours or may extend over days, weeks, or even months. Examples of visits include an outpatient (clinic) visit, a hospitalization, or a visit to the lab. 

**Wiki:** A web site containing documentation and other resources for a project or organization.
