The OpenMRS community actively encourages members to grow as contributors by taking up more advanced roles within the community. Many of our dedicated volunteers began by working on introductory tickets, and went on to become senior contributors within the community, working on a wide range of tasks from core OpenMRS development to working on individual implementations.

The following checklist signifies potential milestones which a developer may follow. Note that these are very generic guidelines, with no strict timelines or strict order of precedence. Rather, they serve as inspiration for potential options available to all community members.
