The OpenMRS Developers manual is hosted at [https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-book-developer-manual](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-book-developer-manual). Anyone is welcome to help us improve the manual by contributing pull requests to this repository.

The book uses basic [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax. We avoid any complex formatting or layout for the sake of simplicity, limiting formatting mostly to headers, lists, hyperlinks, emphasis only when necessary, and an occasional embedded image.
